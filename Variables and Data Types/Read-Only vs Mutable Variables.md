```kotlin
var age = 23 // can be reassigned
val name = "XiaoqiZhang" // can not be reassigned
```

- var lets you declare mutable variables.
- val lets you declare read-only variables.
- Good practice is to prefer val over var whenever possible to reduce mutability and therefore facilitate understanding of the programâ€™s state and data flow.
